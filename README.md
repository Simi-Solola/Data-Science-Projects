# Data-Science-Project

This contains one project I've worked on to brush up my skills in Machine learning

**[Titanic Survival Prediction](https://github.com/Simi-Solola/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Titanic%20Project.ipynb)**

The goal is to correctly predict if someone survived the Titanic shipwreck
